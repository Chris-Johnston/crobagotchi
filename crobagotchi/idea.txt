# Crobagotchi ideas list

phyiscal tomagotchi type device where you can feed, pet, play with crobs

crobs have attributes:

a name - randomly selected from a list?
health - feeding the crob in the last 24 hours is 75%,
        feeding the crob consistently in the past 3 days is 25% (this might be hard to do)
happy - play with the crob 2x / 24 hours, degrades at a linear rate
        OR pet crob, does the same
        OR network with another crob, instant 100, and degrade will cool down

crobs eet potatoes
pet the crob and hearts appear
pet the crob and a hand appears

can network with nearby crobs to create a MURDER

uses a ssd1306 display
esp32 with networking (networking would be really cool, but also really hard?)
the esp32 would have a lot of flash which would make my job easier...
have a physical power switch for the esp32, for maximum power savings
// real time clock that is always powered for save data
so the esp32 has a RTC module
if we are powering it just off of a coin cell, might be fine

probably just use AAs, see if I can get a small connector that can go on the back without being too
big?

if the batteries die, might want to see if I can keep the save data stored in the flash
so that we can swap batteries without killing crobs


couple of buttons to navigate menus and interact
maybe - a piezo for CAWing
